Bad SQL Challenge

Copy-paste this query into the AI and ask for an optimized version:

-- BEGIN BAD QUERY
SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_id, p.sku, p.price
FROM orders o, products p, customers c
WHERE o.product_id = p.id
AND o.customer_id = c.id
AND p.price * o.quantity > 1000
ORDER BY RAND();
-- END BAD QUERY

Instructions for participants:
- Request a high-performance rewrite (index suggestions, LIMIT, replace RAND())
- Test the optimized query on a sample dataset.
